        Hi, I’m Sam! I’m a Physics graduate, turned banking contractor, turned
        software developer currently working through a 12 week bootcamp at
        Northcoders! After realising that my life as a Physicist was not as
        Brian Cox would have you believe, think less awe-inspiring mountain
        ranges and more darkened room with a book of equations, upon graduation
        I stumbled into the banking sector. After multiple contract extensions,
        giving me 7.5 years of experience with a major financial institution, I
        turned 30, the contract ended and I decided it was time to expand my
        skill-set. I’ve always been interested in tech and development, but only
        from a user perspective. What I’ve loved about this course is how
        accessible it has made the once elusive areas of tech. The fact that in
        week 4 we developed a (admittedly rudimentary) Pokemon game completely
        opened up my perspective on the whole industry. FYI - my Pokedex only
        included the first generation, I’m a purist. In case it wasn’t already
        apparent, and completely against stereotype…I’m a training software
        developer who’s essentially just a big nerd - Star Wars, Marvel, Lego,
        comic-con, give me it all! I’m fascinated by the games industry, and
        love the way story telling is evoked through that medium. If only I had
        more time to play them! I also couldn’t imagine my life without music.
        I’ve basically been to a music festival every year of my life since I
        was 17, and I barely have a moment without something playing in the
        background. I had planned for a conventions/gig tour of the USA last
        year, which I hope to rearrange soon! Most of all these past few months
        of preparing for and taking part in the bootcamp have just made me
        realise how much I have missed learning something new. I can’t wait for
        this to continue.
